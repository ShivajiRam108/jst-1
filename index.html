<!-- 1. Scenario: Library System
You are creating a system to manage books in a library. Each book has a title, author, and ISBN.
 The system needs to allow updating the book’s availability status (whether it’s checked out or not) and updating its title.
•             Question:
 How would you define a Book class with properties title, author, and isbn?
–            What methods would you include to:
•             Change the availability status (e.g., checkOut() and returnBook() methods)?
•             Update the book’s title (e.g., updateTitle(newTitle) method)? -->
